# daily-planner-application
A app for planing your day


# Description

first thing I ahev done was to copy and past the starter code into my folder. 

I then dragged to folder into the Vs code. 

I then organised the folder structure. I create a css folder for the css style sheet and a Js  folder for the Js file.

I then updated it on the href links on the html file. 

I then created a section and gave it an id and a class. Inside of that section I created another section and use the grid system for bootstrap to dvide that section into 2 blocks, one for the hour and another one for the text so people can type into the text box what their plans are for that hour. 

I created another 10 sections exactly the same as I want this calendar to start at 6am and finish at 6pm. This is a calendar/daily plan for working hours only. 

I changed to background color from the hour section and the description class to light yellow because I wanted to give it a nice peaceful color. 

On the Js file I created a function to listen to the savedBtn click.
